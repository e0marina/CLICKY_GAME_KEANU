About: This is a game that displays 10 images of Keanu Reeves to the screen. Each time you click an image the score increments as long as you click a unique picture. The tricky part is that it shuffles randomly each time you click! High score is stored in Local Storage.

Tech used: React.js, Vanilla Javascript, Local Storage, Bootstrap.js

Further Development: I'd like to make the display more pleasing to the eye, instead of displayed vertically, horizontally in 2 rows across the screen.
